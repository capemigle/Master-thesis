# Functional Data Analysis of COVID-19 Dynamics in Lithuania

This repository contains the final R Markdown script used to perform the analyses
reported in the Master's thesis "Functional Data Analysis of COVID-19 Dynamics in Lithuania".

The script implements the complete analysis pipeline, including data preprocessing, functional smoothing, Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA), Functional Canonical Correlation Analysis (FCCA), lagged FCCA, and function-on-function regression.

The repository is provided for transparency and reproducibility purposes and is linked as the thesis Appendix.
